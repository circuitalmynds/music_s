Stevie playing Lenny on his first acoustic set at Berkeley Community Center on the 14th of October, 1985. It's my favourite version of this song because of the huge amount of odd licks.  Loosely, Stevie has tuned down 1 half step from his usual Eb tuning. Aka Tune down around 2 frets to play along. This song has been posted before on here, though this one goes for slightly longer. Comment/Rate/Enjoy!
